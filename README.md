# outer-space
what outer space does: outer space is a short and simple website that teaches people about our solar system. it gives information about the sun and each of the 8 planets! it also has a depiction of each planet next to the corresponding info.

why i made outer space: i made outer space during athenathon, and i made it because it combines my love for astronomy with coding! i personally think outer space and our solar system is really cool, and i wanted to help other people realize that as well!

how i made outer space: i made outer space using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as those are the 3 coding languages im best at so far as a new programmer

what i struggled with and learned along the way: i struggled with creating the starry space background, and i learned how to code spheres with CSS and how to make them look like planets! i also learned some more information about our solar system while researching it to make this website!
